# Expression
We need to run the TTMc expression, one for each dimension, so 3 per tensor since all tensors are 3d.

For TTMc-mode1, expression is:

 IM2(i, j, b) = I(i, j, k) * M2(b, k);                                                                                                                                                              
 R(i, b, a) = IM2(i, j, b) * M1(a, j); 

For TTMc-mode2, expression is:

 IM2(i, j, b) = I(i, j, k) * M2(b, k);
 R(j, b, a) = IM2(i, j, b) * M1(a, i);

For TTMc-mode3, expression is:
 IM2(i, k, b) = I(i, j, k) * M2(b, j);
 R(k, b, a) = IM2(i, k, b) * M1(a, i);

We will report one time measurement for each TTMc-mode for each tensor, so 3 times per tensor.

# Data
You will find the data in ~/data_frostt_sparta. There are 4 tensors, each 3 dimensional.
I am adding the metadata first line so it runs okay with sparta.
The matrices M1 and M2 have to be generated. I have written the code to do this given the shape of the tensor "I", using TACO.
You can adapt this code. It is at ~/hpcrl_taco/example/ttmc.cc, lines 129 to 161.
I'm not sure if the matrices should be written to disk, it will take really long. Ideally you can create them in memory and pass it on to SPARTA.



mode 1
((I*M)*N)

mode 2
((I*M)*X)

mode 3
((I*Y)*X)
